/*
* The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object
* that contains all information about the request.
* This transformation lets you pass requests as method arguments,
* delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.
*
* In this example, the Client class creates a Receiver object and two Command objects,
* command1 and command2, which are associated with the receiver.
* The Client also creates an Invoker object and sets the commands to be executed.
* When the invoke method is called, it executes the command.
